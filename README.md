### CommerceCore task (for junior front-end position)
### VUE-JS V3


## About
```
My first priority is always new experience and knowledge, therefore 
I choose to get out of my comfort zone and tried to exeute task in framework I am not familiar with at all.
```
## Ways to improve and self-reflection
```
The code probably will be lacking best practices and unwritten rules of VUE (since YouTube was my teacher). 
I am pretty sure that splitting the whole page in more individual components 
would have been better (for later repurposing and easier management).
Fonts are off because (I was unable to export .ttf from figma). 
Images may lack some resolution.
It was definitely not necessary to reinvent the wheel and make form validation 
by hand, but I choose this path because it was a good place to familiarize with 
the framework's capabilities. But with that, problems occurred: 
1. Credit card (*) and CVV info button are not functional for know (not sure what was the functionality expected). 
2. Error messages when closed/opened pushes other form components down (it is not aesthetically pleasing).
