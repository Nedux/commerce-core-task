### VUE-JS V3


## About
```
My first priority is always new experience and knowledge, therefore 
I choose to get out of my comfort zone and tried to exeute task in framework I am not familiar with at all.
```
## Ways to improve and self-reflection
```
The code probably will be lacking best practices and unwritten rules of VUE (since YouTube was my teacher). 
I am pretty sure that splitting the whole page in more individual components would have been better (for later repurposing and easier management).
Fonts are off because I was unable to export .ttf from figma. 
It was definitely not necessary to reinvent the wheel and make form validation by hand (better to use libraries like Vuelidate),
but I choose this path because it was a good place to familiarize with the framework's capabilities. But with that, problems occurred: 
1. Credit card (*) and CVV info button are not functional for know (not sure what was the functionality expected). 
2. Error messages when closed/opened pushes other form components down (it is not aesthetically pleasing).
